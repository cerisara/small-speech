It's a work in progress for now.

## Details

Every audio record is saved in a file with a timestamped name.
All these WAV files can be FTP'ed into a FTP server by pressing "export WAV".
The FTP server name must be initially entered by pressing "settings".
It must allow anonymous uploads into the directory /upload/.

All the audio files can be deleted on the Android device by pressing "clear".
